Objective
Like trading stories, code is a currency of creativity—I’m a Computer Science student driven by the art of transforming logic into
experiences that empower people. Every algorithm I design and every feature I ship carries my commitment to unlock hidden potential,
streamline complexity, and circulate value. I aim to fuse my foundation in data structures, databases, and full-stack development with
heartfelt curiosity to build features that feel alive, connect communities, and leave a lasting, positive imprint.
